SLERP

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slerp

NLERP
-----

normalized linear interpolation

"gives good results if the interpolated quaternions are reasonably close (difference of about 60 to 90 degrees is still fine) while being very simple and fast"

SQUAD
-----

"spherical quadrangle interpolation"
